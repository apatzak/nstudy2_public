<span class="nstudy" id="ID1">Gases in the atmosphere that transmit visible light but absorb and trap heat </spam> <span class="nstudy" id="ID2">are called greenhouse gases </span>. 
<span class="nstudy" id="ID3">Sunlight travels from the Sun to the Earth</span>, <span class="nstudy" id="ID4">warming clouds, land masses and oceans</span>. 
<span class="nstudy" id="ID5">It is reflected back into space as infrared radiation</span>. 
<span class="nstudy" id="ID6">Infrared radiation is electromagnetic radiation </span> <span class="nstudy" id="ID7"> with wavelengths longer than visible light but shorter than radio waves</span>. 
<span class="nstudy" id="ID8">Eventually, the amount of energy sent from the Sun is about the same as the amount of energy sent back into space</span>, <span class="nstudy" id="ID9">leaving the temperature of the Earth’s surface nearly constant</span>. 
<span class="nstudy" id="ID10">Greenhouse gases cause the greenhouse effect </span> <span class="nstudy" id="ID11">because they allow sunlight to pass through the atmosphere</span>, <span class="nstudy" id="ID12">but do not allow the heat to escape back out</span>. 
<span class="nstudy" id="ID13">The trapped heat increases the temperature of the Earth</span>. 
<span class="nstudy" id="ID14">Common greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere include water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)</span>. 
<br>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID15">Water vapour is water in a vaporous form </span> <span class="nstudy" id="ID16">diffused in the atmosphere </span> <span class="nstudy" id="ID17">but below boiling temperature</span>. 
<span class="nstudy" id="ID18">It accounts for 65% of all greenhouse gases in the atmosphere</span>. 
<span class="nstudy" id="ID19">On a clear night, heat will escape the Earth’s surface,</span> <span class="nstudy" id="ID20">and the temperature will drop</span>. 
<span class="nstudy" id="ID21">However, if there is cloud cover, the heat will remain trapped by the water vapour</span>, <span class="nstudy" id="ID22">and the temperature remains warm</span>. 
<span class="nstudy" id="ID23">For example, the temperature by mid-day in the Gobi Desert can reach as high as 35°C,</span> <span class="nstudy" id="ID24">and then hit a bone chilling -45°C at night</span>. 
<span class="nstudy" id="ID25">This happens because there is little water vapour in the air to trap the heat</span>. <span class="nstudy" id="ID26">The heat escapes into space</span>. 
<br>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID27">Twenty-five percent of greenhouse gases consist of carbon dioxide (CO2).</span> 
<span class="nstudy" id="ID28">Carbon dioxide has been on the increase since the Industrial Revolution.</span> 
<span class="nstudy" id="ID29">Carbon dioxide is formed when carbon joins with oxygen in the atmosphere.</span> 
<span class="nstudy" id="ID30">Carbon is a building block for all living organisms on Earth.</span> 
<span class="nstudy" id="ID31">Dinosaurs, trees, humans and marine algae all contain carbon.</span> 
<span class="nstudy" id="ID32">The amount of carbon on Earth has remained the same since the Earth was formed.</span> 
<span class="nstudy" id="ID33">Carbon combines with other elements and forms different chemicals.</span> 
<span class="nstudy" id="ID34">Many processes take carbon from one chemical,</span> <span class="nstudy" id="ID35">and get rid of carbon in another chemical.</span> 
<span class="nstudy" id="ID36">The path of carbon through the biosphere and atmosphere is called carbon cycling.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID37">Carbon cycling is an important process </span> <span class="nstudy" id="ID38">that allows carbon to be reused </span><span class="nstudy" id="ID39">and recycled by all of Earth’s organisms. </span>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID40">There are several paths carbon takes through the biosphere.</span> 
<span class="nstudy" id="ID41">One path involves plants drawing carbon dioxide out of the air </span> <span class="nstudy" id="ID42">and using it to make biomass and oxygen.</span> 
<span class="nstudy" id="ID43">This process is called photosynthesis.</span> <span class="nstudy" id="ID44">Animals eat plant biomass </span> <span class="nstudy" id="ID45">and convert the carbon into their own biomass.</span> 
<span class="nstudy" id="ID46">After some time, those animals and plants die </span><span class="nstudy" id="ID47">and their biomass breaks down, or decomposes. </span>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID48">Carbon is released into the air and the soil.</span><span class="nstudy" id="ID49"> The carbon that is released into the air once again becomes carbon dioxide.</span> 
<br>
<br>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID50">Dead animals and plants release carbon into the soil.</span><span class="nstudy" id="ID51"> Over millions of years, the carbon gathers and turns into fossil fuels. </span>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID52">For example, a meteor hit the Earth a long time ago,</span><span class="nstudy" id="ID53"> causing all of the dinosaurs to die.</span> 
<span class="nstudy" id="ID54">The dead dinosaurs released carbon into the soil</span><span class="nstudy" id="ID55"> and over millions of years the carbon became fossil fuel. </span>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID56">Types of fossil fuels include petroleum, coal and natural gas. </span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID57">Another way carbon is released into the atmosphere involves cellular respiration. </span>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID58">Cellular respiration is the process by which animals convert sugars and oxygen from the air into carbon dioxide and water. </span>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID59">This carbon dioxide goes in the atmosphere.</span>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID60"> Volcanic eruptions and other large-scale catastrophic events release carbon from rocks deep down in the Earth’s crust. </span>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID61">The Earth’s crust is the outer layer of the Earth. </span> <span class="nstudy" id="ID62">Once released, the carbon joins with oxygen </span> <span class="nstudy" id="ID63">and forms carbon dioxide. </span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID64">Lastly, carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere </span> <span class="nstudy" id="ID65">and turned into carbonates by the ocean. </span> <span class="nstudy" id="ID66">Many marine organisms use carbonate to make their shells.</span> 
<br>
<br>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID67">If something takes carbon out of the air, it is called a carbon sink. </span>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID68">If something releases carbon back into the atmosphere, it is called a carbon source. </span>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID69">For example, plants, trees and oceans are carbon sinks </span> <span class="nstudy" id="ID70">because they take carbon out of the air. </span>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID71">Carbon is released into the atmosphere </span> <span class="nstudy" id="ID72">both as a result of human</span> <span class="nstudy" id="ID73"> and natural activity. </span>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID74">Human activities include burning fossil fuels</span>,<span class="nstudy" id="ID75"> natural activities include volcanic eruptions. </span>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID76">Humans can also indirectly increase the carbon in the air by destroying carbon sinks. </span>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID77">For example, when humans cut down trees (deforestation), </span><span class="nstudy" id="ID78">then the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere also goes up. </span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID79">People burn fossil fuels to create energy</span><span class="nstudy" id="ID80"> to power industrial plants, homes, and cars. </span>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID81">Burning fossil fuels releases carbon back into the air, </span><span class="nstudy" id="ID82">where it joins with oxygen to make carbon dioxide. </span>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID83">Global fossil fuel CO2 emissions were 26.8 billion tonnes in 2003. </span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID84">Humans also burn biomass for varying reasons.</span>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID85"> Biomass includes forests, plants, and crops. </span>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID86">Sometimes trees are burned to clear them for people to build their houses. </span>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID87">Other times, old crops are burned to make room for new crops. </span>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID88">Burning biomass also releases carbon into the air,</span><span class="nstudy" id="ID89"> where it joins with oxygen to make carbon dioxide. </span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID90">Not only are CFCs greenhouse gases, </span> <span class="nstudy" id="ID91">but they also have been shown to deplete the Earth’s ozone or protective layer. </span>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID92">They are used in aerosols, refrigerators and air conditioners.</span>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID93">The ozone prevents harmful UV light from reaching the Earth. </span>
<span class="nstudy" id="ID94">UV light is electromagnetic radiation </span> with a wavelength shorter than that of visible light, </span> <span class="nstudy" id="ID95">but longer than X-rays.</span> 
<span class="nstudy" id="ID96">One consequence of the ozone hole is that the harmful rays of the Sun will damage plants on land</span><span class="nstudy" id="ID97"> and reduce the plankton population, </span><span class="nstudy" id="ID98">both of which are carbon sinks. </span>
