<span>nStudy is an online learning tool. It helps you organize information you study and manage that information. It also keeps track of your work. nStudy requires you to install an extension to your Chrome web browser. See the section &#34How do I access nStudy?&#34. In this description, we <i>italicize</i> terms of the vocabulary of nStudy and how it works.</span>
<br>
<p>nStudy has two different views: a &#34<i>Reading view</i>&#34 and a &#34<i>Maps</i> view&#34</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Reading view, you can create objects such as <i>Highlights</i> and <i><i class="term" data-ot="A Note is where you can record general comments about information you are studying."> Notes </i></i> with different templates.</i>
<br>
<br>

<p><li>Each object you create, stays attached to the location in which it was created</li>

<ol>
<p>This is how the <i>Reading view</i> will look in your Chrome browser: </p>

<br>
<br>
<li>In the <i>Maps</i> view, you can work with object you had already created while reading such as <i class="term" data-ot="A quote is text in a web page that you want to copy and keep.">Quote</i> and <i>Notes</i>, and also create new objects such as <i class="term" data-ot="A Note is where you can record general comments about information you are studying.">Notes</i>, <i class="term" data-ot=" A Term is an important concept.">Terms</i>, <i class="term" data-ot=" A Document is where you can write an essay or a report.">Documents</i>, <i>Chats</i> and <i class="term" data-ot=" Groups are like folders where you keep and organize your notes, terms and documents.">Groups</i>.</li>
<br>
<li>Each object you create, stays attached to the location in which it was created</li>
